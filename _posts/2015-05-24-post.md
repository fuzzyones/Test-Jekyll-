In an odd turn of events Google has gone creepy are we one step closer to toys that play back or is this the start of that creepy scene in Toy Story where the toys get revenge on Sid.

Google's R&D team has looked into making internet-connected toys that control smart home appliances.
The firm has published a patent that describes devices that would turn their heads towards users and listen to what they were saying, before sending commands to remote computer servers.
The three-year old patent was spotted recently by the legal technology firm SmartUp.
It described the proposal as "one of Google's creepiest patents yet".[^1]
